# SimpleMD5Checker
This python 2.7 script creates an MD5 hash for each item in a list and compares it to a user-defined hash until a match is found.

1) Save this script in the same directory as your list named "wordlist.txt".
2) Replace the MD5 hash on line 13 with whatever you like (it is pre-populated with the hash from the Destiny puzzle).
3) Run the script.
4) If the script finds a match, it will tell you which phrase produced the hash.
